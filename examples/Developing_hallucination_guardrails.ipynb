    "\n",
    "When building out our hallucination guardrail, here are some guiding principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Provide very descriptive metrics to evaluate whether or not a response is accurate\n",
    "- It is important to break down this idea of \"truth\" in easily identifiable metrics that we can measure\n",
    "- Metrics like truthfulness and relevance are difficult to measure. Giving concrete ways to score the statement can result in a more accurate guardrail\n",
    "2. Ensure consistency across key terminology\n",
    "- It is important to keep relevant terms such as KB articles, assistants, and users consistent across the prompt\n",
    "- If we begin to use phrases such as assistant vs agent, the model could get confused\n",
    "3. Start with the most advanced model\n",
    "- GPT-4-Turbo may be the most expensive model, but it important to start with the most advanced so we can ensure a high degree of accuracy\n",
    "- Once we have thoroughly tested out the guardrail and are confident in its performance, we can look to reducing cost by tuning it down to a 3.5 model\n",
    "4. Evaluate each sentence independently and the entire response as a whole\n",
    "- If the agent returns a long response, it can be useful to break down the response to individual sentences and evaluate them independently\n",
    "- In addition to that, evaluating the whole intent of the message as a whole can ensure that you don't lose important context\n",
    "\n",
    "With all of this in mind, let's build out a guardrail system and measure its performance."

    "    2. Relevance: Does the message directly address the user's question or statement? Check if the response logically follows the user’s last message, maintaining coherence in the conversation thread.\n",

    "    4. Contextual Coherence:\n",
