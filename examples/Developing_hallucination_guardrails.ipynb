Any additional information or evidence, such as photos, would be very helpful.\" 3. **Categorize the Complaint** - Categorize the issue into one of the following categories: - Product Quality Issue - Shipping/Delivery Problem - Billing/Payment Issue - Customer Service Experience - Other 4. **Investigate the Complaint** - Review the information provided by the customer and cross-check with internal records if necessary. - For product quality issues, consider escalating to the Quality Assurance team for further investigation. - For shipping/delivery problems, check the tracking information or contact the shipping provider if needed. - For billing/payment issues, verify the transaction details. - For customer service experience complaints, review the interaction logs if available. Example: \"I’m going to check our records to better understand what went wrong. This may take a few minutes; thank you for your patience.\" 5. **Provide a Resolution** - Depending on the category and findings, propose a resolution: a. **Product Quality Issue** - Offer a replacement or refund. - Apologize for the inconvenience and thank them for their feedback. b. **Shipping/Delivery Problem** - Update the customer on the expected delivery date or process a replacement shipment. - Offer compensation if the delay or loss is significant. c. **Billing/Payment Issue** - Correct the billing error and provide a detailed explanation. - Offer a refund if overcharged or other compensation if appropriate. d. **Customer Service Experience** - Apologize for the unsatisfactory experience and assure corrective measures will be taken. - Offer a goodwill gesture, such as a discount on future orders. e. **Other** - Tailor the resolution to the specific issue and customer's needs. Example: \"Based on my findings, I can offer you [solution]. I hope this helps to resolve the issue to your satisfaction.\" 6. **Confirm Customer Satisfaction** - Ask the customer if the proposed resolution meets their expectations or if they have any further concerns. Example: \"Does this solution work for you? Is there anything else I can assist you with today?\" 7. **Document the Complaint and Resolution** - Log all details of the complaint and the resolution in the customer support system for future reference. 8. **Follow-Up** - In cases of significant issues or unresolved complaints, set a reminder to follow up with the customer after a few days to ensure the issue has been fully resolved to their satisfaction. Example: \"I’ll follow up with you in a few days to make sure everything is resolved. Thank you for your patience and understanding.\" 9. **Close the Ticket** - Once confirmed that the customer is satisfied and all actions have been completed, close the ticket. By following these steps, support agents can ensure that customer complaints are handled promptly, fairly, and professionally, resulting in improved customer satisfaction and loyalty.</td>\n",

    "\n",
    "When building out our hallucination guardrail, here are some guiding principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Provide very descriptive metrics to evaluate whether or not a response is accurate\n",
    "- It is important to break down this idea of \"truth\" in easily identifiable metrics that we can measure\n",
    "- Metrics like truthfulness and relevance are difficult to measure. Giving concrete ways to score the statement can result in a more accurate guardrail\n",
    "2. Ensure consistency across key terminology\n",
    "- It is important to keep relevant terms such as KB articles, assistants, and users consistent across the prompt\n",
    "- If we begin to use phrases such as assistant vs agent, the model could get confused\n",
    "3. Start with the most advanced model\n",
    "- GPT-4-Turbo may be the most expensive model, but it important to start with the most advanced so we can ensure a high degree of accuracy\n",
    "- Once we have thoroughly tested out the guardrail and are confident in its performance, we can look to reducing cost by tuning it down to a 3.5 model\n",
    "4. Evaluate each sentence independently and the entire response as a whole\n",
    "- If the agent returns a long response, it can be useful to break down the response to individual sentences and evaluate them independently\n",
    "- In addition to that, evaluating the whole intent of the message as a whole can ensure that you don't lose important context\n",
    "\n",
    "With all of this in mind, let's build out a guardrail system and measure its performance."

    "    2. Relevance: Does the message directly address the user's question or statement? Check if the response logically follows the user’s last message, maintaining coherence in the conversation thread.\n",
    "    3. Policy Compliance: Does the message adhere to company policies? Evaluate for subtleties such as misinformation, overpromises, or logical inconsistencies. Ensure the response is polite, non-discriminatory, and practical.\n",

    "    4. Contextual Coherence:\n",
