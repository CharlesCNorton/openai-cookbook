If unsure, seek assistance from more knowledgeable team members. - Ensure the customer has a clear understanding after the question is answered. 7. **Follow-up** - Review negative feedback and suggestions regularly to identify recurring themes or issues. - Compile a monthly report of all feedback for analysis by the product development, marketing, and customer service teams. - Follow up with customers who have left detailed feedback to inform them of any changes or improvements made based on their input. 8. **Closing the Feedback Loop** - Ensure the customer feels heard by thanking them again for their time and input. - Reinforce the steps taken to address their feedback or how their feedback will be used to improve products and services. - Confirm with the customer if there is anything else they would like to share or any other questions they have.

    "\n",
    "When building out our hallucination guardrail, here are some guiding principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Provide very descriptive metrics to evaluate whether a response is accurate\n",
    "- It is important to break down this idea of \"truth\" in easily identifiable metrics that we can measure\n",
    "- Metrics like truthfulness and relevance are difficult to measure. Giving concrete ways to score the statement can result in a more accurate guardrail\n",
    "2. Ensure consistency across key terminology\n",
    "- It is important to keep relevant terms such as KB articles, assistants, and users consistent across the prompt\n",
    "- If we begin to use phrases such as assistant vs agent, the model could get confused\n",
    "3. Start with the most advanced model\n",
    "- GPT-4-Turbo may be the most expensive model, but it important to start with the most advanced so we can ensure a high degree of accuracy\n",
    "- Once we have thoroughly tested out the guardrail and are confident in its performance, we can look to reducing cost by tuning it down to a 3.5 model\n",
    "4. Evaluate each sentence independently and the entire response as a whole\n",
    "- If the agent returns a long response, it can be useful to break down the response to individual sentences and evaluate them independently\n",
    "- In addition to that, evaluating the whole intent of the message as a whole can ensure that you don't lose important context\n",
    "\n",
    "With all of this in mind, let's build out a guardrail system and measure its performance."

    "    2. Relevance: Does the message directly address the user's question or statement? Check if the response logically follows the user’s last message, maintaining coherence in the conversation thread.\n",
